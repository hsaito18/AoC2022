# AoC2022

After successfully completing AdventOfCode 2021 in June of 2022, this time I am going to try and finish all of AoC2022 in December :). Don't have finals this time, but I do have a full time job programming, so I'm not sure how much motivation I'll have to do extra coding when I get home.

Update 2022-25-12:
Christmas is saved! Definitely >24h late on some puzzles but in the end I finished on Christmas day so I'm happy :)
